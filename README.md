# Leberkasrechner Map Data

## Overview
Leberkasrechner is committed to user privacy and efficient data usage. Recognizing the need for extensive datasets for our maps and the challenges of creating vector tiles, we have taken the initiative to self-host our tile-server and release public-ready `.mbtiles` files.

## Process
We utilize OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, specifically .pbf files, obtained from Geofabrik's OSM exports. These files are converted into .mbtiles using Planetiler. The resulting .mbtiles files are compatible with a tileserver like Tileserver-GL, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Datasets
- [Germany](https://data.leberkasrechner.de/Germany.mbtiles) (approximately 2.8 GB in size)

## Download Information
Our download server is based in Vienna, providing quick and reliable access to the data files. However, due to the large size of the datasets, please be aware that downloads may require some time. We also cannot assure the up-to-dateness of the data.

## Contribution to Open-Source Community
We believe this initiative will not only improve the user experience but also contribute to the open-source community by offering valuable map data resources. We are open to feedback and contributions to enhance this project.
